Google Data Analytics Capstone Project 

CASE STUDY: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success? 

 

INTRODUCTION 

This optional case study will serve as my capstone for the Google Data Analytics Certificate courses. The method applied in this case study will be the “Six Phases of Data Analysis” taught in the course. The phases are: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act. As part of my findings, I was asked to issue three recommendations for the marketing department. 

 

BACKGROUND 

I’m a junior data analyst for a fictitious company named Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, Illinois. Cyclistic’s bike-share program features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Users that purchase annual memberships are known as annual members. All other users are known as casual riders. 

The director of marketing, Ms. Lily Moreno, believes that the company’s future success will be based on maximizing the number of annual memberships. This means, turning casual riders into annual members. This is also based on Cyclistic’s financial analysts stating that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.
